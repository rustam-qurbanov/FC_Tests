# FitnessCourt Automated Test Suite

A modular, robust end-to-end automated testing framework for the **FitnessCourt** Admin Portal using **Python**, **Pytest**, and **Playwright**. It employs the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern to keep test cases clean, legible, and maintainable.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- FitnessCourt application running locally (or pointing to a remote staging server)

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
# Navigate to test folder
cd FC_Tests

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate on macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Or on Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install Python libraries and download the browser binaries required by Playwright:
```bash
# Install pip dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download Playwright web drivers
playwright install chromium
```

### 4. Configuration
Create your local environment configuration file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` and set parameters appropriate for your target environment:
- `BASE_URL`: The URL of the frontend (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
- `API_URL`: The URL of the backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Valid owner credentials matching target DB state.
- `HEADLESS`: `true` to run browsers in the background, or `false` to see browser windows.

## Running Tests

### Run all tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Run specific test suites using custom markers
```bash
# Run only authentication tests
pytest -m auth

# Run only members management tests
pytest -m members

# Run only dashboard tests
pytest -m dashboard
```

### Run tests in headed browser mode
To observe the browser actions on screen during local execution:
```bash
pytest --headed
```

### Run tests across multiple CPU cores in parallel
```bash
pytest -n auto
```

## Reports and Artifacts
- **HTML Report**: Pytest yields a detailed visual HTML report after runs, saved at `reports/report.html`.
- **Screenshots**: Page Object error callbacks or manual captures save images to `reports/screenshots/`.
